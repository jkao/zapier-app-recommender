And if it all gets too much, you can use Selective Sync to keep only some folders in your Dropbox synced, to save space on your computer while still keeping the files in the cloud.", "Dropbox came at the perfect time. Just as computing went mobile, and we were more likely to work on the go from a tablet than sit behind a PC, Dropbox was there to make sure our files were ready wherever we were. You\u2019ll find Dropbox integration in many web and mobile apps, such as the writing app Draft, where you can open files from Dropbox and edit them, then save new files back to Dropbox so you can open them in other apps. And, of course, you can automatically save pictures, email attachments, and more to Dropbox using Zapier. Or you could just keep using your traditional software like Word and Photoshop, and Dropbox will happily keep those files synced.", "It\u2019ll also keep them backed up. While we wouldn\u2019t recommend using Dropbox as your only backup, it does give you an extra bit of safety by keeping all your files on each of your computers, plus in the cloud.

If your computer falls into the wrong hands, you can remotely wipe your files with a Dropbox Pro subscription.

And, it was one of the first online applications with an API, so you could send information to Salesforce from any other app\u2014the beginnings of what would make apps like Zapier possible.", "Thus Salesforce was born as one of the first major Software as a Service products. Use it today, and both its origins from a team  of people from a databasing company and its long legacy as an online application are both readily apparent. These both give it versatility to be useful for almost any need and the deep industry recognition and support to be common among most large enterprises, but they also give it a dated feeling compared to other web apps.", "Today, Salesforce is more than just a CRM.

If you\u2019re using Salesforce\u2019s default apps, you\u2019ll be picking between different features that are all powered by the same platform. There\u2019s the default Sales Cloud, a customizable CRM with all the contact tracking, reports, automation, and email integration you\u2019d expect from a CRM. There\u2019s also the Service Cloud which uses the same contact database to help you provide support to your customers and more.", "You\u2019ll also find the Marketing cloud, numerous other apps on the AppExchange, and other smaller apps like Desk.com for simple email support, Chatter for team chat, RelateIQ for simple email CRM, and Heroku for hosting your own web apps.

They\u2019re all built on the same online database system, and each let you customize them for the features you need. Their web apps look quite dated, but the companion mobile apps feature a far more modern design. Plus, thanks to API integrations, you\u2019ll use Salesforce as the place to keep all your data, but will likely only use certain parts of the app yourself since there\u2019s so much in Salesforce.", "You\u2019ll find detailed analytics with customizable reports on anything you need to keep tabs on, along with forecasting that\u2019ll help you plan the future of your company based on your recent sales and growth.

All of that\u2019s built off the same contact database, so you can find anything manually whenever you need.", "Salesforce will take you time to learn and customize to your needs, and it\u2019ll likely be less \u201cfun\u201d to start using than other newer CRMs. But if you need a powerful sales tool that\u2019s been part of the enterprise world for over a decade and a half, there\u2019s little better to choose from than Salesforce.

Simple, routine tasks can be handled with just a simple checkbox, and slightly more advanced processes might just need a few kanban columns to stay organized. But for large development projects, you need a space to list everything that needs done, plan the work out into compatible chunks, ship the changes, and track what's been changed over time.", "That's why JIRA is one of the more popular project management tools for software development. It's built around shipping finished tasks as releases, complete with the standard release notes the App Store has made so familiar. And with deep integrations with its parent company Atlisian's other apps, including Confluence documentation, Bamboo tests, BitBucket repositories, and HipChat conversations, it's a tool that can fit right at the center of your workflow if you're already using those tools.", "It starts with your issues, the things that need worked on. They don't have to be problems\u2014you can create any type of issue you need, to list new features, plain tasks, improvements, bugs, and more. Categorize the issue, with priority levels, statuses, and resolutions. Statuses are a quick way to set a task's stage in a workflow, perhaps listing the things you're working on or planning to do next, while resolutions let you mark duplicate tasks, finished items, or tasks you'll skip. There's also components, a way to group tasks into smaller sections\u2014perhaps putting writing tasks together in one component, code tasks in another.", "Then, it's time to pull the tasks into a workflow. Each issue has to be assigned to a project, where you'll arrange tasks either in Scrum sprints or Kanban lists. With scrum, you'll drag tasks into a sprint from the backlog list, then work through them on a simpler kanban list. Kanban boards, on the other hand, let you make a workflow of your own with as many columns as you need, each divided into \"swimlines\" to bring the highest priority tasks to the top.", "As you work, tasks will eventually be moved over to the", "Done", "column\u2014and you'll get closer to releasing a new version of your product.

There's advanced online tools, too, so you can send vacation replies, sort email automatically, and more.

Spreadsheets are still primarily used for crunching numbers, but they're also often used for lists. Whether you're keeping track of inventory, creating a database of contacts, or making a quick editorial calendar, a spreadsheet's layout is perfect for organizing stuff. They're a quick and easy solution that anyone can use.", "So versatile are spreadsheets, in fact, it often seems they're seldom used for their intended purpose. While Excel documents can be adapted\u2014somewhat uneasily\u2014to be used for project management, lists of contacts, and more, Smartsheet is an online spreadsheet that is specifically designed for keeping track of both numbers and non-numeric data, with collaborative features built in.", "The Smartsheet workflow is based around templates. You can create a blank sheet, but the library of presets is impressively extensive, covering a variety of use cases, from IT projects and client management, to law and finance, sales sheets, and just a plain to-do list. Your newly created document lives in a tab of its own within your dashboard, along with tabs for any other spreadsheets you may have open. This arrangement means you can easily flick between various sheets, as well as go back to the inbox-like Home page.", "Editing a spreadsheet is a largely familiar process, with a few added extras. If you use a template, the columns come with titles and display formats. A basic task list, for instance, has space for the name and due date of each item, along with the person it is assigned to, and further comments. You can add rows and columns as you please, while the left-hand menu provides text formatting tools, along with access to cell linking, formula creation, export options, and the ability to switch views.", "At the start of each row, more options can be selected: you can choose to attach a file to a particular row, start a discussion on that item, and schedule an email reminder if the task has a due date. If you use any of these features, an icon appears in the row as a reminder.", "These functions are more easily accessed through the menu at the bottom of your document, where you will also find a form builder. This allows you to embed a form in your website, with every submission being automatically added to a new row. This works beautifully for building a client list, or handling customer care requests. Aside from the standard sheet view, Smartsheet has other methods of displaying your data. If you create or select a template that includes start and end dates, one option is to view tasks in a Gantt chart. Alternatively, due dates can be put into context with the calendar view.", "Teamwork is another important part of Smartsheet\u2019s offering. As with most online office suites, you have full control over who can read and edit any of your documents, and the ability to send email invites. In your Home tab, Workspaces act as public folders \u2014 any sheet, discussion, or attachment you place inside can be viewed by your chosen colleagues.", "The Home tab is where you will find two more useful areas: Reports and Dashboard. Reports let you search through your account and create a new document from individual rows in your spreadsheets, summarizing important info and giving you a quick way to show how things are going. Dashboards, on the other hand, provides the broadest of overviews, detailing every row you have favorited, every new spreadsheet created, and reminders coming up in the calendar. They're a great way to see everything that's going on throughout your account.", "Along with the standalone online platform, Smartsheet has add-ons that allow you to edit your documents from within the Office 365 version of Outlook, and hook up contacts with Azure Active Directory. That way, it can be an extra spreadsheet tool that works alongside your existing Microsoft Office documents.", "Smartsheets aren't just your standard spreadsheet. Sure, you could use them to tabulate numbers and list data, but it's view options make it much better for the to-do list, project management, scheduling and other functions we tend to force onto other spreadsheet apps. It's a spreadsheet for all the other things\u2014a versatile way to organize data and view it in the way you want.", "Reviewed by Mark Myerson, Zapier.

You'll often need several steps or subtasks to get it done, and Wunderlist offers a set of tools to help you manage them all. Double-click on a task to open up a sidebar where you can add a reminder, a list of subtasks, comments and notes. You can also star the task for more prominence on your list, assign a due date to the task, or attach a file from either your computer or a Dropbox account. The Dropbox integration is especially handy as it ensures you always have a copy of your files within reach wherever you go\u2014they'll be in your Dropbox folder, as well as in your tasks.", "More often than not, we need others to help us get our work done. Wunderlist makes collaboration easy and straightforward by letting you share lists with others. Simply add your collaborator's name or email address and Wunderlist will either add them to your list automatically (if they're a registered user) or prompt them to sign up for an account to be able to access the list. You can add collaborators before creating a new list or clicking on the Share button found at the top menu of the app. Once all of the collaborators gain access to the list, you can create tasks, leave comments, attach files, and more. Wunderlist makes sure you're up to date on what's going on by notifying you through in-app notifications called Activities and Conversations. Activities are notifications for when a task is modified (e.g. Bob added a file) while Conversations are for tasks that you've commented on.", "Let's talk pricing.

In comparison, free users can, for example, upload files up to 5MB or assign up to 25 todos per shared list only. If you decide to go Pro, that's only $4.99 a month to unlock all of the features.

It's nicely designed, so perhaps you'll want to open it every day just to see its real-time reports about your team's productivity. It can run in your web browser, mobile device, or Mac, letting you track time right inside any other apps you use. In fact, that's perhaps its best feature: install the mobile extensions, and you'll see time tracking buttons pop up in GitHub, Trello, Basecamp, and other popular apps, so you can track what you're working on without ever opening Harvest itself.", "You'll likely remember to use it, though, because Harvest makes it so easy to turn your time into money. Track every minute you spend on your clients' projects, and Harvest will automatically turn that time into invoices you can send out and get paid directly inside Harvest. You can even start the entire process in Harvest, sending an estimate based on older projects, then tracking time you spend on won projects, and finally sending the invoice and getting paid right inside Harvest.", "There's more, too. Harvest has direct integrations with dozens of web apps\u2014and hundreds more via Zapier\u2014so you can log time spent directly from other apps. Have a 2 hour long meeting with your client scheduled in Google Calendar? Harvest can automatically add that time to your timesheets. And if you need to invoice your clients for more than just your time, Harvest lets you log expenses from the web or your mobile device. You can even scan in receipts from your phone, add them to a project, and roll them up with your timesheets into invoices.", "It'd be a shame to gather all of this data about your team's time and expenses without any way to analyze it all. Harvest's real-time reports are perfect for that. You'll find graphs of your team's productivity, breakdowns of where your time and money went, and a quick list of your uninvoiced time. It'll be easier than ever to figure out how to optimize your workflow.", "Harvest also includes a couple companion apps to help your team work together better.

And one of the worst mundane tasks is filling in template documents.", "Whether you have to regurally create contracts, invoices, rental agreements, or any other documents, copying the data from a form or application and pasting it into a Word document is time consuming at best, error-fraught at worst. That\u2019s why you need WebMerge. It\u2019s an app that helps you collect customer data, automatically import it into any document, and send it off to the customer or anyone else.", "WebMerge needs two items: a template document and the information to merge into it. You can upload an existing template Word document, PDF file, Excel spreadsheet, PowerPoint presentation, or an HTML template for a document. Or, you can make your own template from scratch on the WebMerge site. When creating the template, you indicate which fields you would like to merge with", "{$_____ }", "fields.

WebMerge uses the fields in the template, and lets you customize what data you would like to receive. You can also use rules to indicate which document the data entries should go into. For example, let\u2019s say you collect a name, address, and phone number for a customer, and you want to create both a contract and an invoice using this information. You can use the data routing feature to route this information to both documents automatically. Then, you can choose what to do with the the finished documents: save them in Google Drive or Dropbox, perhaps, or email them to a specific address. The document can also be sent to different signature apps, as a quick way to create a contract from a template and have it sent to a client to get their signature.", "Now that all of the set up for your merged document has been completed, you can gather your data into the document templates. WebMerge provides you with a few different ways to do this. Each template you create comes with its own unique URL that can be used as a form to fill in the information you need to gather. You can also upload data you\u2019ve gather manually using a .csv file. Or, you can use web apps like Zapier that have built in integrations to pull in data from hundreds of apps or existing online forms to add to your documents. For example, I use a Zapier integration that takes the information from a Jotform form and pulls it into a contract template in WebMerge, then emails the contract to the customer once it\u2019s created.", "WebMerge is one of those apps that you may not realize how much of a time saver it can be until you actually use it.

You can then add extra info with tags to organize contacts as you like, or link contacts based on any relationship you\u2019d like\u2014not just the company they work for. This will help you easily get the big picture about the people you\u2019re working with.

It\u2019ll link those messages to your contacts automatically, and even show other contacts who are usually included in your conversations with that person to automatically show your relationships. And if you\u2019d like to keep the conversation going, you can reply right from Insightly or start a new Gmail message just by clicking on the email address in Insightly.

There\u2019s less project management features than a full project manager, but if your tasks typically are focused on your contacts, it\u2019s a great way to manage your team\u2019s work inside your CRM without needing another app. Plus, Insightly\u2019s deep email integration comes in handy with email reminders about the things you need to do.", "Insightly reports are also impressive. You\u2019ll find almost as many types of reports and report customization options in Insightly as you would in Salesforce. There\u2019s also a quick Print button to turn your reports into PDFs, and export tools so you can analyze your data elsewhere.", "If your team\u2019s already used to working in Google Apps, and you\u2019d like a more powerful way to manage your contacts and the things you need to do, Insightly\u2019s a great option.

You'll want to think through the items you need to track in your app, how they relate to each other, and what format they'll be in, and make fields for each of them.", "You can add your own individually, or select the", "Quick add", "column to import object templates. There's company, employee, contact, product, and order templates, each with appropriate fields (say, company name, logo, website, industry, address and more for the", "Companies", "option) pre-added. Or, you can import a spreadsheet that already has data you've been collecting, and Knack with create appropriate objects and fields and import the data accordingly.", "Then, it's time to make your app's interface. Switch over to the", "Interface", "tab, and you can add new pages with forms to add new entries to your database objects, tables to display the data in your objects, reports that list your data in unique ways, and more. That sounds tedious, but Knack does a lot of the heavy lifting for you to speed things up. Add a form to add new entries to your app, for instance, and Knack will automatically add fields for each of the elements you'd put in your database object previously, each formatted for the type of data you need. There will be a short box for a name, perhaps, a longer one for a description, and an upload button for a photo.", "Viewing your data is similarly simple. You'll pick from popular views\u2014a spreadsheet-like table, a search tool, a gallery that emphasizes pictures, and a map that lays out your data on a map\u2014to show your data, or different graphs and charts to make sense of it, and Knack will try to automatically pull the object entries you have into that view design so you can see your data without too much interface tweaking.", "Once you've got the system to collect and show the data you want, it's time to put it to work. You can use your Knack app on your own, of course, but if you've built it for your business you likely want others to use it as well. All you'll need to do is add them as users, and set their permissions so they can do anything from tweak the app further, add data, or just be able to view existing data depending on the permissions you give them. You can make a password protected page for your Knack app, or could even make your app's data\u2014or some of it\u2014public and embed it in your website. That way, you can use Knack as an advanced way to make forms and then showcase the data from them in your site.", "You're not going to build the next Instagram in Knack, but then you weren't planning on that. What you may use it for is making quick apps for the internal business needs you have, rather than just keeping track of everything in yet another spreadsheet. Knack will make it faster to find the data you need, give you easier ways to visualize and put it to use, and you'll have a system that only asks for the things you want to keep track of.

Then, you can add your own custom coding and simple functions to show or hide fields, route data, or automate actions without much trouble.", "Zoho Creator focuses on the forms in your app first, and uses them to build your database and everything else. It's a smart move\u2014you'll need to create form fields to collect any data in your app, so Zoho lets you think through what you need to collect and turns those elements into your database.

The simplest way to do that is with reports, spreadsheet-like views that let you show your data on a table, in a graph, on a map, or quickly sort through it in a pivot table.

But if you want more, there's also pages in Zoho Creator. Select to add a new page, and you'll see an editor similar to the Workflows page that lets you code your own app page in HTML or with drag-and-drop elements. You could write a paragraph of text with the HTML block, then bring in one of the forms you made previously, and underneath let users see the data immediately in a table. You can add conditions, pull data from your database, and more.

That\u2019s a great way to put those holiday and event email templates to work for you; make a drip that emails everyone on their birthday, or that sends a coupon on holidays, and you\u2019ll be doing more marketing in less time.", "Designing a beautifully handcrafted email template or writing a series of brilliant drip emails takes a lot of time, though.

If you would like to monetize your course, TalentLMS lets you accept payments from both PayPal and Stripe, and classes can be set up for a one time or subscription based fee. Then, for an extra touch of customization, you can add gamification features to courses to make them more engaging. Students can earn badges, points, rewards for future discounts, and even see how they are doing on the leaderboard.

That\u2019s where Fleep makes email better. Instead of bouncing back and forth between email and Fleep to message people, you could just use Fleep. When you message someone who is not using Fleep, just add their email address and they get an email with the message you sent them. They can then do one of two things: either join Fleep and continue the conversation there, or they can just send you an email back and you will get their message inside of Fleep. You can then continue to keep messaging with them even though they are using email. This comes in handy when you want to just stick to one application for communication with others.", "Another handy way Fleep helps you keep in touch is with Google Hangouts. Not only can you type and send messages to others who don\u2019t use Fleep, but you can also start video and audio calls in Hangouts for free. You also get to use all of the other great features of Hangouts as well, like screen sharing, which can be great for teams that work remotely. This adds another layer to communication with others that you just don\u2019t get in a simple messaging app.", "It\u2019s this ability to pull all of your communications into one app that makes Fleep so handy.

Osmosis is designed with the idea that if you gather as much info about projects as possible before starting, you'll have a far better chance of a final proposal that'll get signed and turned into a paid project.

You can start with them and customize to your needs, or you can make your own questionnaires that include any info you need. You'll want to get as much info as possible, with full-sentence questions and wide text areas that let your potential clients send their full answers.

Instead of just a one-page proposal with a line for your client to sign, Osmosis proposals pull together all the data you've gathered, as well as any terms, conditions, and additional information you'd like to include. There's a rich text editor where you can add as much text as you want, to make sure everyone's literally on the same page.", "Then, send off your proposal, and Osmosis will notify you as soon as it's been read. Your client can sign the proposal on their screen, and then you can set Osmosis to send a file or a QuickBooks invoice\u2014or anything else via Zapier integrations\u2014as soon as the proposal is signed. And you'll be ready to get to work on the project, with a full record of everything the client wants and your interactions with them all in one place.", "Osmosis is an interesting take on a proposal app, one that makes it easier to ensure you're fulfilling your clients' wishes and making proposals they're sure to accept.

It is designed for anyone who needs communications with global reach.", "Start off with messages, where under the Messaging tab, you create your first message via a pop-up window where you enter up to 160 characters. You can send the message as a regular SMS, or have Magpi read out the text in a call\u2014in 17 different languages. Alternatively, you can record your own audio message.", "Magpi lets you import multiple messages in a spreadsheet, and it offers a similar function with contact lists. You can also add people individually and set up groups. To schedule a message, you simply select some of your contacts and pick any future date. The message can be sent just once, or repeated on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis.", "The more advanced Dynamic Message Timing tab lets you send repeat messages to contacts in a certain group and with a specific tag. For instance, you could create a group of support staff, and send daily updates only to the people with the tag \"On Call.\" You can see the upcoming schedule in a separate tab, and even enter holidays to take them out of the schedule.", "You can also gather data with Magpi via the Forms tab. The Design tool is simple, letting you focus solely on the data you want to collect and using the default form design on connected devices to style the form. Along with plain text fields, you can ask for integers and decimals, and set up multiple choice questions with drop-down, radio button and checkbox fields. You can also pick up the GPS location of the user, and insert labels in order to separate sections.", "Each field lets you add a custom prompt and name, with the option to require a response. For more complex forms, Magpi offers logic-based fields. These let you skip questions or send a message based on previous answers, and numbers entered in other fields can be used in calculations. Inputted data can be viewed and analyzed in separate tables, and you can set up responses to send to folks who complete the form.", "There are three ways to publish your form. Smartphone users can simply download the Magpi app, and Structured SMS lets users return their answers in a single text message, using formatted answers instead of data fields as a bot of sorts. Alternatively, you can collect data via SMS in automated back-and-forth conversations.", "Whether you are a marketer looking to reach a new audience, or a project manager with a global team, Magpi makes it really easy to stay connected. You can contact anyone automatically, gather data on the go, and expand your reach to everyone with a phone\u2014not just those with smartphones.", "Learn more about gathering data with forms in our free", "Ultimate Guide to Forms and Surveys", "book.", "Reviewed by Mark Myerson, Zapier.
